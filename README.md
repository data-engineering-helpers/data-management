Knowledge Sharing - Data Management
===================================

# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-management)
intends to collect, analyze and synthetize referential material
about data management, _i.e._, how to build and operate so-called
Modern Data Stack (MDS) and Modern Metadata Platform (MMP).

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.
